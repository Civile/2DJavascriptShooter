Canvas 2d shooter platform game

HTML5 Platform game, unprofessional, no temporal dimension (delta time) but working, poor structuring. The game was developed to have two modes: campaign and survival, but i choose to leave it only in survival mode because of the time! Built from scratch using canvas APIs and Javascript only without the support of any framework but create js as sounds handler.
